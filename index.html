            <p><b>Howard Phillips Lovecraft</b> (1890 - Marc h 15, 1937) was an American writer of weird, science,
                fantasy, and horror fiction. He is best known for his creation of the <b>Cthulhu Mythos</b>.Born in
                <b>Providence, Rhode Island,</b> Lovecraft spent most of his life in New England. After his father's
                institutionalization in 1893, he lived affluently until his family's wealth dissipated after the death
                of his grandfather. Lovecraft then lived with his mother, in reduced financial security, until her
                institutionalization in 1919. He began to write essays for the United Amateur Press Association, and in
                1913 wrote a critical letter to a pulp magazine that ultimately led to his involvement in pulp fiction.
                He became active in the speculative fiction community and was published in several pulp magazines.
                Lovecraft moved to New York City, marrying Sonia Greene in 1924, and later became the center of a wider
                group of authors known as the <i>"Lovecraft Circle"</i>. They introduced him to <b>Weird Tales,</b>
                which would become his most prominent publisher. Lovecraft's time in New York took a toll on his mental
                state and financial conditions. He returned to Providence in 1926 and produced some of his most popular
                works, including <i>Call of Cthulhu, At the Mountains of Madness, The Shadow over Innsmouth, and The
                    Shadow Out of Time.</i> He would remain active as a writer for 11 years until his death from
                intestinal cancer at the age of 46.
